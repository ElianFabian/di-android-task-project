# di-android-task-project

This app allows you to manage your tasks.

This project is to practice concepts like creating a layout and using a recycler view with MVP (Model View Presenter).

These are the operations you can do:
- Add new tasks.
- Edit them.
- Delete them.
- Undo (get back one by one the deleted tasks).
- Check them.
- Uncheck them all and make them visible again in the task list.
- Sort them alphabetically and in reverse order.
